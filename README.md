# Tip Calculator App âž—âœ–

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the Tip Calculator App built using Vue.js. This project is part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.

## Project description ðŸ“œ

This is a single-page application designed as a tip calculator. The goal was to recreate the provided designs, ensuring an optimal layout across various devices while adding essential functionality. I developed the project using Vue.js and made a few customizations to the final look, along with introducing additional options to the calculator.

The mobile, tablet, and desktop layout concepts, as well as the text and image content, were provided by Frontend Mentor.
